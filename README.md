# BMI Calculator

This program calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight and height. The BMI is then used to determine the weight category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese).

## Getting Started

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Go installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from the official [Go website](https://golang.org/).

2. Clone this repository or download the `main.go` file.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `main.go` file is located.

4. Run the following command to compile and execute the program:

   ```shell
   go run main.go
   ```

5. Follow the prompts on the console to enter your name, age, and choose the unit system.

6. Enter the required information (height and weight) based on the chosen unit system.

7. The program will calculate your BMI and display it along with your weight category.

## Unit Systems

The program supports two unit systems for height and weight input:

1. Metric (kg/m): Height can be entered in either meters (m) or centimeters (cm), and weight should be provided in kilograms (kg).

2. US Customary (lb/ft/in): Height can be entered in feet (ft) and inches (in), and weight should be provided in pounds (lb).

## BMI Calculation

The BMI is calculated using the following formulas:

- Metric: `BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))`

- US Customary: `BMI = (weight (lb) / (height (in) * height (in))) * 703`

## Weight Categories

Based on the calculated BMI, the program outputs the following weight categories:

- Underweight: BMI < 18.5
- Normal weight: 18.5 <= BMI < 25
- Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 30
- Obese: BMI >= 30
